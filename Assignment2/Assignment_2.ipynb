    "\n",
    "We use the `TEXT` field to define how the review should be processed, and the `LABEL` field to process the sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our `TEXT` field has `tokenize='spacy'` as an argument. This defines that the \"tokenization\" (the act of splitting the string into discrete \"tokens\") should be done using the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) tokenizer. If no `tokenize` argument is passed, the default is simply splitting the string on spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LABEL` is defined by a `LabelField`, a special subset of the `Field` class specifically used for handling labels. We will explain the `dtype` argument later.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll be using *packed padded sequences*, which will make our LSTM only process the non-padded elements of our sequence, and for any padded element the `output` will be a zero tensor. To use packed padded sequences, we have to tell the RNN how long the actual sequences are. We do this by setting `include_lengths = True` for our `TEXT` field. This will cause `batch.text` to now be a tuple with the first element being our sentence (a numericalized tensor that has been padded) and the second element being the actual lengths of our sentences."

This embedding layer is simply a single fully connected layer. As well as reducing the dimensionality of the input to the LSTM, there is the theory that words which have similar impact on the sentiment of the review are mapped close together in this dense vector space. We will initialize the embedding layer with GloVe embeddings.\n",

The prediction is then made from the final hidden state of the final (highest) layer.\n",

    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to learn the embedding for the `<pad>` token. This is because we want to explitictly tell our model that padding tokens are irrelevant to determining the sentiment of a sentence. This means the embedding for the pad token will remain at what it is initialized to (we initialize it to all zeros later). We do this by passing the index of our pad token as the `padding_idx` argument to the `nn.Embedding` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an RNN instead of the LSTM, you can use `nn.RNN` instead of `nn.LSTM`. Also, note that the LSTM returns the `output` and a tuple of the final `hidden` state and the final `cell` state, whereas the standard RNN only returned the `output` and final `hidden` state. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the final hidden state of our LSTM has both a forward and a backward component, which will be concatenated together, the size of the input to the `nn.Linear` layer is twice that of the hidden dimension size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing bidirectionality and adding additional layers are done by passing values for the `num_layers` and `bidirectional` arguments for the RNN/LSTM. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM has a `dropout` argument which adds dropout on the connections between hidden states in one layer to hidden states in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are passing the lengths of our sentences to be able to use packed padded sequences, we have to add a second argument, `text_lengths`, to `forward`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we pass our embeddings to the LSTM, we need to pack them, which we do with `nn.utils.rnn.packed_padded_sequence`. This will cause our LSTM to only process the non-padded elements of our sequence. The LSTM will then return `packed_output` (a packed sequence) as well as the `hidden` and `cell` states (both of which are tensors). Without packed padded sequences, `hidden` and `cell` are tensors from the last element in the sequence, which will most probably be a pad token, however when using packed padded sequences they are both from the last non-padded element in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then unpack the output sequence, with `nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`, to transform it from a packed sequence to a tensor. The elements of `output` from padding tokens will be zero tensors (tensors where every element is zero). Usually, we only have to unpack output if we are going to use it later on in the model. Although we aren't in this case, we still unpack the sequence just to show how it is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final hidden state, `hidden`, has a shape of _[num layers $\\times$ num directions, batch size, hid dim]_. These are ordered: _[forward_layer_0, backward_layer_0, forward_layer_1, backward_layer 1]_. As we want the final (top) layer forward and backward hidden states, we get `hidden[2,:,:]` and `hidden[3,:,:]`, and concatenate them together before passing them to the linear layer (after applying dropout). \n",
    "\n",
    "The input dimension is the dimension of the one-hot vectors, which is equal to the vocabulary size i.e. 25,002. \n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding dimension is the size of the dense word vectors i.e. 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden dimension is the size of the hidden states i.e. 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output dimension is usually the number of classes, however in the case of only 2 classes the output value is between 0 and 1 and thus can be 1-dimensional, i.e. a single scalar real number."
